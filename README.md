# Where is the math in Casino Risk of Ruin by Ivan Contreras Arvizu
This repository explores the mathematical principles behind the concept of “Risk of Ruin” in casinos. It introduces a probabilistic model that estimates the likelihood of a casino going bankrupt, based on concepts like binomial distributions, Poisson approximation, and house edge.

## Introduction
Since I was young, I’ve been curious about how randomness and chance work. Although I never took formal courses in probability, I’ve always wanted to understand it better. When I had the chance to freely choose a topic, I saw this project as the perfect opportunity to explore probability through something unusual but engaging: the **Risk of Ruin** in casino games.

That curiosity led me to the following question:  
**Can a casino actually go bankrupt if a gambler gets lucky enough?**  
This is the essence of the Risk of Ruin (ROR) the probability that a casino loses all its capital due to a rare sequence of wins by a player. While casinos are designed with a statistical advantage (house edge), randomness introduces a non-zero risk of failure.

To analyze this, I study a probabilistic model based on **binomial distributions**, **Poisson approximations**, and the concept of **house edge**, inspired by the paper from Siu et al. (2023). This project allowed me to apply mathematical modeling techniques commonly used in real world for analyzing failure, uncertainty, and risk to a dynamic and unpredictable scenario.

### Motivational videos
Before diving into the math, here are a couple of short videos that introduce some of the key concepts in a simple and engaging way. They caught my attention from the start I hope they do the same for you.

## Preliminary Video
This is an intrioductory video is a visual summary of my project *“Where is the math in the Casino’s Risk of Ruin?”* It introduces the key ideas behind the concept, such as how a casino can lose money over time despite having the advantage. I also explain in very basic terms the mathematical tools used like binomial, Poisson distributions, and the house edge.
